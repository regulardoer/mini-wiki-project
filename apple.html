        <h2>About Apple</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs,
            Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The company initially focused
            on personal computers before transforming the global technology
            industry with the launch of the <em>iPhone</em> in 2007.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apple is widely recognized for its commitment to innovation,
            minimalist design philosophy, and premium user experience.
            Its tightly integrated ecosystem allows seamless interaction
            between hardware, software, and services.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, Apple is one of the most valuable corporations in the world,
            influencing consumer electronics, digital services, and mobile technology.

        <h2>Market Influence and Global Impact</h2>

        <p>
            Apple operates one of the most profitable business models in
            the technology sector, generating revenue from hardware sales,
            subscription services, and digital platforms such as the App Store.
        </p>

        <p>
            The company has also positioned itself as a leader in
            user privacy advocacy, differentiating its brand from
            advertising-driven competitors.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, Apple has faced regulatory scrutiny regarding
            app store policies, market competition, and supply chain practices.
